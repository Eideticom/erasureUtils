// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The reason we generate these settings at config-time (instead of just
// supplying -Dfoo on the command-line at compile-time) is that this
// library (part of libne), and its include files, may be used by other
// systems (e.g. MarFS), which do not know about what our generated
// Makefiles are doing.
//
// There are structs in this library (e.g. GenericFD in udal.h, used in
// ne_handle) that look different when they are built in a setup that is
// configured to support sockets.  Therefore, an external system that
// includes our header-files should be assured that it will use the same
// structures that were in effect when our library was compiled.

// Among other things, values for DEBUG_SOCKETS affect delays tolerated

// it makes sense that configuration used to build the server should be the
// same one used in the client.  However, those things are all built into
// executables, at build time, so the values in the .h files can apparently
// be safely allowed to diverge.
